## Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs writting for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX-Africa SE.
In the project, I learned about C programming concepts and data structures, algorithms. I also learned about the use of C programming language and it's real world implementation to solving world's biggest problems.
